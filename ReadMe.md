# FIREARMS EXPANSION 1.2 CAN BE FOUND AT THE LINKS BELOW: 
https://github.com/Jayick/Firearms-1.2

https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/208

## Requirements:
Requires Alpha 17 version of 7 Days to Die. Will not work on A16.4 or lesser.
Suggested for minigun that you have decent framerates. Pixel textures on fire may cause FPS drops in lower end clients.
Some guns will skip your game upon loading in the hotbar. Their file size is quite large. Fix coming soon hopefully.

## Known bug: 
- In multiplayer and live servers, ACOG view model will be overridden by the user who last equipt the scope. So if you have an ACOG out, and your friend takes theirs out, you will see through their viewpoint. If you unequipped, and reequip, they will then see through yours. Working on a fix now. Removed it from core files and placed it in it's own Modlet found here. https://github.com/Jayick/ACOG-Single-Player DO NOT USE ON LIVE SERVERS! 

## About this Modlet:
Custom Weapons and Attachments (ACOG only at the moment)
Fully craftable, gated by progression, added to open world loot table, fully repairable/modable, custom audio, custom fire rates, custom damage and modifiers, and best of all, custom sighting.
This entire mod is written in xpath, no edits needed to any core files. Sadly, no localization.txt yet, so no in game info text menu. All other UI works/functions perfectly.
Silencers are finely tuned for game balance. Using a silencer will now reduce the amount of zombies in the surround area that flock to your POI, and inside alerts. You can now strategically move through a building and pick zombies off one by one with percision aim!

Modlet also comes with a placeable Target block with a center mark. Craftable at a very low cost for easy target use with friends! [Preview of how the target works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNcjQHJT3hE)

## Crafting requirements and information:
All guns and ammo are tied to progression system for crafting. This is located as a NEW perk under INTELLECT Attribute: Craftsmanship Perks. [Preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca4bFOUGNZs)
All guns and ammo are tied together via progression. When you unlock the firearm, you unlock the ammunition as well.

## CRAFTING COSTS:

Most guns are based off of existing in game components (Steel, Forged Iron, Mechanical Parts, Duct Tape, Glue, Wood, etc). The cost for these weapons is high, especially end-game weapons such as the Chaingun and Golden Gun.


## How to install
- Navigate to your 7 Days to Die Directory (default: C:/ProgramFiles86/Steam/Steamapps/Common/7DaystoDie)
- Right click anywhere in your MAIN directory (not Data/Configs, not 7DaysToDie_Data), and create New Folder 
- Name New Folder: Mods [Our directory should look similar to something like this](https://imgur.com/a/pm5sJKc)
- Download entire mod pack via GitHub or other Trusted source (I only share via Discord, and GitHub. For my personal mods, do not trust any other source unless verified by me)
- Drag and Drop Firearms modlet into 7 Days To Die/Mods folder. [Our modlet named "Firearms" should show up under the mods directory like so](https://imgur.com/a/YtYmNW3)
- To confirm proper boot, upon loading into a map/server, press F1, and you should see our mod load with the following line: 
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Trying to load from Firearms`
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Loaded Mod: Firearms (1.0)`
