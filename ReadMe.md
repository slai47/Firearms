# Firearms Modlet Expansion 1.2!
This is an expansion modlet. This modlet is set to run on it's own. You DO NOT need the previous version of Firearms to run this. Lots of bug fixes, changes, adjustments, and 10 new amazing weapons! From the Argh! pistol, to the M79 GL40 Grenade Launcher!

## Suggested:
Please remove any previous version of Firearms that you have before installing. Please launch a test map BEFORE you connect to your live game, to assure files are correctly pathed and no errors occur that will hinder your game. Additional weapons added may adjust previous weapons. You may of had a M4A1 Rifle before install, but now have a Mossberg Shotgun. I apologize, but due to XML changes and naming errors/pathing errors, core original XML files had to be changed, resulting in this "shift" of inventory.

## Changes:
Most important change to highlight: AMMO! Ammo can now be crafted into "Scrap Ammo" at varying values at anytime while out in the open world. This recipe is unlocked by default, no cost required. Scrap Ammo, can now be turned into ONE of the users following at a workbench: 3 Gun Power, 1 Brass Casing, 1 Lead Tip, 1 Buckshot.
- Added iconic sound to M1 Garand [as viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OuGYUZjnMA)
- Reduced recoil on M240 when aim'ed and crouched
- Fixed iron sights on multiple weapons
- Fixed Reflex Sight on multiple weapons, opened it up on FN FAL (previously M14/Assault Rifle). AR15 remains unsighted. Can't remove gun assets Iron Sights as they are meshed to the gun itself. Will explore 3d modeling new rifle, or editing it out in the future.
- Fixed naming on 38 Snubnose and FN FAL (338 Snubnose/M14&Assault Rifle)
- Changed audio properties on silencer weapons, giving new sounds to older weapons, adjusting sound volumes
- Adjusted loot slightly in attempts to spawn higher grade gear
- Adjusted textures on some weapons in attempts to brighten them
- Adjusted Reflex/Barrel view models to slightly smaller on some weapons
- Fixed audio loop with some weapons


## Added 9 new weapons!
 - Argh! Pistol
 - MP5
 - M1A1 Thompson (Aka Chicago Typewriter, Aka Tommy Gun)
 - Mossberg 590A1 Shotgun
 - Facepunch's Rust AK47
 - M16
 - Ak47
 - SR25 Long range rifle
 - M79 GL40 single tubed Grenade Launcher! [as viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb9CO_siVN8)
 - Hand Cannon mini launcher!

## Requirements:
Requires Alpha 17 version of 7 Days to Die. Will not work on A16.4 or lesser.
Suggested for minigun that you have decent framerates. Pixel textures on fire may cause FPS drops in lower end clients.
Some guns will skip your game upon loading in the hotbar. Their file size is quite large. Fix coming soon hopefully. Guns should not lag after first load.

## About this Modlet:
Custom Weapons and Attachments.
Fully craftable, gated by progression, added to open world loot table, fully repairable/modable, custom audio, custom fire rates, custom damage and modifiers, and best of all, custom sighting.
This entire mod is written in xpath, no edits needed to any core files. Sadly, no localization.txt yet, so no in game info text menu. All other UI works/functions perfectly.
Silencers are finely tuned for game balance. Using a silencer will now reduce the amount of zombies in the surround area that flock to your POI, and inside alerts. You can now strategically move through a building and pick zombies off one by one with percision aim!

Modlet also comes with a placeable Target block with a center mark. Craftable at a very low cost for easy target use with friends! [Preview of how the target works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNcjQHJT3hE)

## Crafting requirements and information:
All guns and ammo are tied to progression system for crafting. This is located as a NEW perk under INTELLECT Attribute: Craftsmanship Perks. [Preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca4bFOUGNZs)
All guns and ammo are tied together via progression. When you unlock the firearm, you unlock the ammunition as well.


## CRAFTING COSTS:
Most guns are based off of existing in game components (Steel, Forged Iron, Mechanical Parts, Duct Tape, Glue, Wood, etc). The cost for these weapons is high, especially end-game weapons such as the Chaingun and Golden Gun.

Ammo can now be crafted into "Scrap Ammo" at varying values at anytime while out in the open world. This recipe is unlocked by default, no cost required. Scrap Ammo, can now be turned into ONE of the users following at a workbench: 3 Gun Power, 1 Brass Casing, 1 Lead Tip, 1 Buckshot.

## How to install
- Navigate to your 7 Days to Die Directory (default: C:/ProgramFiles86/Steam/Steamapps/Common/7DaystoDie)
- Right click anywhere in your MAIN directory (not Data/Configs, not 7DaysToDie_Data), and create New Folder 
- Name New Folder: Mods [Our directory should look similar to something like this](https://imgur.com/a/pm5sJKc)
- Download entire mod pack via GitHub or other Trusted source (I only share via Discord, and GitHub. For my personal mods, do not trust any other source unless verified by me)
- Drag and Drop Firearms modlet into 7 Days To Die/Mods folder. [Our modlet named "Firearms" should show up under the mods directory like so](https://imgur.com/a/YtYmNW3)
- To confirm proper boot, upon loading into a map/server, press F1, and you should see our mod load with the following line: 
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Trying to load from Firearms`
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Loaded Mod: Firearms (1.0)`

## A special thankyou!
A big thankyou to Yoshinoya for helping me test this mod, and providing me with some outstanding feedback to give you guys the best possible mod I can. Without his amazing help, I'd be swarmed with so much testing and checking, that I couldn't possibly update these projects in a timely fashion.

A special thankyou to the following people, without their help, advice, and guidance this work would not be possible. These people are the backbone to our community, lending their skills to us all so we can complete amazing pieces of art for everyone to enjoy! Very much respect and admiration for these creators!
